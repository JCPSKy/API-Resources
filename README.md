API Resources
===================
A collection of API resources at Jefferson County Public Schools.

File: Api Documentation.docx contains definitions for all of the district's growing API endpoints. Many of these endpoints require authorization. If no personal information exists, the endpoint is open. All APIs are governed by the Terms of Service articulated below.

Folder: developer-tos contains a sample terms of service template for United States public school districts and a sample version of that API from Jefferson County Public Schools.
