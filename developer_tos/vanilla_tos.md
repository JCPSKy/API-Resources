# API Terms of Service Agreement

This United States public school system, {{County}} Public Schools ("{{SchoolSystemAbbreviation}}”), offers some of its public data in machine-readable format through an API (Application Programming Interface), a service located at {{APISite}}. Use of the data made available via the API is generally unrestricted ([see “Data Rights and Usage”](#data-rights-and-usage)). However, the service through which we make that data available is offered subject to your acceptance of the terms and conditions contained herein as well as any relevant sections of the {{SchoolSystemAbbreviation}} Website Policies ({{PolicySite}}).

## Scope
The service (“API”) through which you may access {{SchoolSystemAbbreviation}} public data is subject to these terms. Use of the API constitutes acceptance of this Agreement.

## Data Rights and Usage
Unless otherwise noted, the content, data, documentation, code, and related materials associated with the API is public domain and made available with a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode) dedication. In short, {{SchoolSystemAbbreviation}} waives all rights to the work worldwide under copyright law, including all related and neighboring rights, to the extent allowed by law. You can copy, modify, distribute, and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission. {{SchoolSystemAbbreviation}} makes no warranties about the work, and disclaims liability for all uses of the work, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

Some data from the API may not be public domain, such as copies of copyrightable works made available to the {{SchoolSystemAbbreviation}} by private entities and data related to individual privacy.  {{SchoolSystemAbbreviation}} may make these works available under the fair use provision of the Copyright Act or as a result of regulatory directives. Therefore, your rights to use those works may be similarly limited. Works where CC0 do not apply will be clearly marked by a warning in the relevant documentation (for example: “This data is not in the public domain. Third party copy rights may apply.”).

### Attribution
While not required, when using content, data, documentation, code, and related materials associated with the API in your own work, we ask that proper credit be given.

## Service Management

### Right to Limit
Your use of the API may be subject to certain limitations on access, calls, or use as set forth within this Agreement or otherwise provided by {{SchoolSystemAbbreviation}}. These limitations are designed to manage load on the system, promote equitable access, and prevent abuse. If {{SchoolSystemAbbreviation}} reasonably believes that you have attempted to exceed or circumvent these limits, your ability to use the API may be temporarily or permanently blocked. {{SchoolSystemAbbreviation}} may monitor your use of the API to improve the service or to ensure compliance with this Agreement.

### Service Termination
If you wish to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by refraining from further use of the API. {{SchoolSystemAbbreviation}} reserves the right (though not the obligation) to: (1) refuse to provide the API to you, if it is {{SchoolSystemAbbreviation}}’s opinion that use violates any {{SchoolSystemAbbreviation}} policy; or (2) terminate or deny you access to and use of all or part of the API at any time for any other reason in its sole discretion. All provisions of this Agreement, which by their nature should survive termination, shall survive termination including, without limitation, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.

## Liability

### Disclaimer of Warranties
The API platform is provided "as is" and on an "as-available" basis. While we will do our best to ensure the service is available and functional at all times, {{SchoolSystemAbbreviation}} hereby disclaim all warranties of any kind, express or implied, including without limitation the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. {{SchoolSystemAbbreviation}} makes no warranty that data will be error free or that access thereto will be continuous or uninterrupted.

### Limitations on Liability
In no event will {{SchoolSystemAbbreviation}} be liable with respect to any subject matter of this Agreement under any contract, negligence, strict liability or other legal or equitable theory for: (1) any special, incidental, or consequential damages; (2) the cost of procurement of substitute products or services; (3) for interruption of use or loss or corruption of data; or (4) for any other cause.

## Severability
If any part of this Agreement is deemed to be invalid or illegal, all remaining provisions and language in this Agreement shall remain in effect.

## Miscellaneous
This Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between {{SchoolSystemAbbreviation}} and you concerning the subject matter hereof, and may only be modified by the posting of a revised version of this Agreement by {{SchoolSystemAbbreviation}}.

## Disputes

### Choice of Law
Any disputes arising out of this Agreement and access to or use of the API shall be governed by {{State}} law and the laws of the United States of America.

### Forum Selection
Any disputes arising out of this Agreement and access to or use of the API shall be finally resolved by the appropriate {{County}}, {{State}} court. If the matter is removed to or originated in any of the U.S. District Courts of the United States, the parties agree that the {{PreferredFederalDistrict}} District of {{State}} is the appropriate venue for the the action, without waiving the right to challenge the jurisdiction of any federal court over said matter.

## No Waiver Rights
{{SchoolSystemAbbreviation}}’s failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute waiver of such right or provision.
