Developer-Resources
===================
A public domain Web API Terms of Service document for United States public school systems. (To do: Make it internationally applicable.)

This resource is a very open web API, broadly releasing the data from the Web API in the public domain, under a CC0 1.0 license.
https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/

It carefully covers service and use restrictions for the promised resources, while enabling developers to use the API without restriction.

This ToS is a best of both worlds effort, based on Federal agency standards, intended to enable developers to focus on development and restrict the effect of promises made by the API provider.
